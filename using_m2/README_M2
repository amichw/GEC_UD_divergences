#information on m2 grammatical correction extracting diverges

#what you need:
m2 files (preferably after errant, to provide consisitency)

#process:
1) preprocessing.py - given as an argument a directory with m2 files, it will create
new files (one sentence on each line) one of the original and one with the corrected sentences
2) run udpipe on these files to get 2 conllu files (one original, one corrected)
3) run GEC_UD_divergences/GEC_UD_divergences_m2.py with original conllu file, corrected conllu file,
and matching m2 file. This will give you confusion matrices.
